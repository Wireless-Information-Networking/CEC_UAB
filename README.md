The Yar Smart House Simulator is a desktop application designed to simulate and monitor a smart home environment. It generates real-time data for energy management, water usage, and climate conditions, presenting this data through an interactive dashboard. The application is built using Electron for the frontend (with a web-based dashboard) and Python for the backend simulation logic. The dashboard provides insights into metrics like energy consumption, solar production, battery status, water usage, and climate conditions, with options to filter data by time range and export the dashboard in multiple formats.
